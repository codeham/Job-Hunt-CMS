## What is Job Hunt ?
  Why is it so hard to keep track of every place you've applied to when you begin your employment journey ?
  Of course there are many amazing search engines that query and cater to your exact specifications, but wouldn't it be nice
  to have all this data organized in one centralized repository at your disposal ?

  data metrics for recognizing job market hiring patterns.

   * Easily keep track of multiple job applications without the hassle of searching 
     through excel sheets and old emails.

### Future Features
   * Exporting entries in PDF format
   * Visual data analytics utilizing Graph.js
